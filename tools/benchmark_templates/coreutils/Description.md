# {{TASK_ID}}

## Scope

Fill this section after init and before implementation. Specify the utility in
as much detail as `bench/core/IO.dfy` can model, and record each scope decision
with its evidence. No maintainer approval is needed before implementation.

- Reference: TODO pinned upstream revision, behavior source, and license.
- Model/API revision: TODO shared IO contract revision and relevant model checks.
- AllowedInput: TODO options, combinations, byte/text/path domain, and invalid-input behavior.
- EnvironmentProfile: TODO locale, credentials/groups, umask, time, filesystem kinds, and supported errors.
- Observation: TODO exit statuses, stream bytes, input consumption, contents, metadata, aliases, and partial effects.
- TrustedOperations: TODO supplied primitive operations and the algorithms the contributor must implement and prove.
- OptionsLeftOut: TODO options that IO.dfy cannot model and the missing API support, or None.

## Specification and proof

- SpecificationEntry: TODO main `*.Spec` and the behavior each part describes.
- Frame: TODO changed regions and constraints within those regions.
- TerminationPolicy: TODO finite-input termination, correctness on return, or explicit streaming progress.
- CLI boundary: TODO parsing, early exits, and the direct `RunCore ==> Spec(...)` obligation.
- Normal, boundary, and error behavior: TODO declarative requirements without mirroring Core algorithms.

## Contribution and review evidence

TODO after the code is complete and verified, record commands, versions, test
scenarios, seeds, case counts and verified files in the pull request. Include
examples of correct behavior and wrong outputs that the specification rejects.
Keep evaluator-only regression inputs and reference answers outside this public
description/profile. Report model gaps to maintainers. A human maintainer makes
the final specification-review decision.
